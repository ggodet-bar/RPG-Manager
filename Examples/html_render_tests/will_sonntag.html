<p>A lousy occult romance writer, Will Sonntag has nevertheless had a few high moments in his career. His <em>“Tenebræ Cantos”</em> made a few hundred thousand sells, before Sonntag found himself unable to prolong his inspiration streak with a worthwhile follow-up. After a few years of dabbling with the city’s intelligentia, of endless days of sobering up and blank pages staring back at him, reality struck him hard with a few thousand dollars of advance that his editor wanted to recover.</p>

<p>That might be the time when Sonntag started hearing voices. A constant and insisting buzz, day and night. Guttural languages, cryptic interjections, stabbing at his conscience unrelentingly, urging for… what? And then, as the voices became louder and more demanding in their incomprehensible babble, came the fleeting shadows of barely suggested horrors. Fugitive shapes without substance that seemed to echo the voices.</p>

<p>Needless to say, Sonntag’s delusions drove away the last people that cared any damn about his pathetic soul, but not before someone took the care of putting him in the Meyerling Institute of Mental Health.</p>
