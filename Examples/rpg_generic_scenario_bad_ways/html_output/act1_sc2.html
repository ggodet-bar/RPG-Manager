<h2>Scene synopsis</h2>
<p class="">Questions about the events surrounding Harry Endring’s death, link with a
probable supernatural act and the Baron Hobo solution to get information.</p>
</div>

<p>The PCs will certainly take refuge in a coffee shop called <em>The endless corner</em> 
in order to discuss what they’ve just been witness to. They will hopefully try to 
recollect what has been happening since Sonntag was brought into the police
station. Of course, the only person that might be linked with the events
is Baron Hobo. Experienced GMs are encouraged to let their players
wander around a bit, and maybe throw an occult event or two if they get
stuck. Less confident GMs should find a way
to bring back the PCs to the stations (Caleb Anders will <em>eventually</em> be
called by hierarchy, after all), where they would meet again the
baron.</p>

<h2>Occult events downtown</h2>
<ul title="Occult events downtown" class="">
<li>The PCs meet a priest congregation as they move around town (they
suddenly stop and stare at Sonntag, some of them mumbling a prayer to
Saint George).</li>
  <li>The lights flicker along Sonntag’s path. They even go out completely
in the creepiest place (e.g., in the corridors of the subway). The PCs
suddenly realize they’re completely alone, while growling voices
rise louder and louder… And suddenly the lights return, and people
flood in the place with the usual commuter hubbub.</li>
</ul>

<div class="sidenote box">
<h2>Location description</h2>
<p title="Location description" class="">A typical coffee shop on a random street corner. A waitress bringing
lukewarm coffee without ever looking at the PCs. Terrible news on the TV
(a journalist team has arrived at the warehouse were the murder was
committed. The crime scene is gruesome. Quiet, offbeat music resonating
during the whole scene.</p>
