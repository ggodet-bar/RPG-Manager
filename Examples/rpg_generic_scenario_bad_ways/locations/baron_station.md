TITLE: Legba Station
ABBR: station

npc!legb chose to reside in this abandoned station decades ago. He
receives demons and angels in an old subway wagon that was conveniently
forgotten in front of the station's quay. These receptions follow a
complex protocol that occasional visitors are generally unable to
comprehend.

npc!legb's presence in this place was sufficient to weaken the frontiers between
the spirits world and reality. As a result, the laws of physics may not
be scrupulously followed in the station's whereabouts. As the visitor
reaches the station via a maze of decrepit subway tunnels and crumbling
sewers, reality gets thinner and thinner. The human appearance of demons
and angels progressively fades away, until they reach npc!legb's wagon
in full mystic apparel.

Manifestations of the Void sometimes manage to breach reality around the
station. They are immediately repelled by npc!legb's small horde of
jinns.
