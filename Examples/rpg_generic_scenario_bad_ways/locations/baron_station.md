# Baron Station

Papa Legba chose to reside in this abandoned station decades ago. His
presence in this place was sufficient to weaken the frontiers between
the spirits world and reality. As a result, the laws of physics may not
be scrupulously followed in the station's whereabouts.

Demons and angels are received by Papa Legba in an old subway wagon that
was conveniently forgotten in front of the station's quay. These
receptions follow a complex protocol that occasional visitors are
generally unable to comprehend.
