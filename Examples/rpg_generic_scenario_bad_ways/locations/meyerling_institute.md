TITLE: Meyerling Institute of Mental Health

For as long as people remember, the Meyerling Institute has always been
an hospital for treating the mentally ill. Rumor has it that its
construction was financed by a wealthy factory owner, whose son (or
daughter, depending on who tells the story) was slowly sinking into
dementia. Despite its 19th century style, the institute claims to be at
the edge of modern psychiatry.

The large door made of wood, glass and wrought iron opens to a lobby.
This hall is paved with slabs of white and dark green marble. A soft
light is diffused by the dome stained glass mosaic on the top of the
hall. Three stages appear between the ground floor and the dome, all
connected by the same staircase that climbs by twining from the lobby.
Long corridors start of each level, each leading to heavy doors hiding
the different wings of the asylum.
