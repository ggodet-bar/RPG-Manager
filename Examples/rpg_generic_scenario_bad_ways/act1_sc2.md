# Scene 2 - A Strange Death


Questions about the events surrounding Harry Endring's death, link with a
probable supernatural act and the npc!legb track to get information.
{: .synopsis}

The PCs will certainly take refuge in a coffee shop called _The endless
Corner_ in order to discuss what they've just been witness to. They will
hopefully try to recollect what has been happening since Sonntag was
brought into the police station. Of course, the only person that might
be linked with the events is npc!legb. Experienced GMs are encouraged
to let their players wander around a bit, and maybe throw an occult
event or two if they get stuck. Less confident GMs should find a way to
bring back the PCs to the stations (Caleb Anders will _eventually_ be
called by hierarchy, after all), where they would meet again npc!legb.

- The PCs meet a priest congregation as they move around town (they
  suddenly stop and stare at Sonntag, some of them mumbling a prayer to
  Saint George).
- The lights flicker along Sonntag's path. They even go out completely
  in the creepiest place (e.g., in the corridors of the subway). The PCs
  suddenly realize they're completely alone, while growling voices
  rise louder and louder... And suddenly the lights return, and people
  flood in the place with the usual commuter hubbub.

A typical coffee shop on a random street corner. A waitress bringing
lukewarm coffee without ever looking at the PCs. Terrible news on the TV
(a journalist team has arrived at the warehouse where the murder was
committed. The crime scene is gruesome. Quiet, offbeat music resonating
during the whole scene.
