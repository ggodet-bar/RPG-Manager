For as long as people remember, the Meyerling Institute has always been an
hospital for treating the mentally ill. Rumor has it that its construction was
financed by a wealthy factory owner, whose son (or daughter, depending on who
tells the story) was slowly sinking into dementia. Despite its 19th century
style, the institute claims to be at the edge of modern psychiatry.
