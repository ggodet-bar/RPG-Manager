TITLE: Papa Legba
ABBR: legb

A strange Cajun homeless madman.

He is the guardian of the border between the human world, Hell and
Paradise. He lives in a subway station that he chose to materialize this
border. It is common knowledge that the fees he requests for the
crossing are often curious natures ...  In the confidences of the
intrigues of the three parties, it has long chosen to remain neutral and
enforce rules that benefit all three. Few people are familiar with this
curious character finally, everything can be sure that even if his body
is mortal, his soul has been around a long time.

Although they are rarely seen, a small army of jinns are under Legba's
responsibility. These sentient spirits share his burden of keeping the
occult forces in a state of balance. Contrary to their semi-human
collaborator, the jinns never put on a physical appearance. They may
appear to witnesses as flashes of light, swift shadows or small patches
of fog moving at unusual speed. Additionally, the jinns are able to
communicate intelligibly with angels and demons alone, but may only
reach out to humans through sensations and blurred dreams.

Initiated since immemorial time to ancient arts, Papa Legba knows many rituals, 
some harmless, others scary. Of all, the ritual of banishment is the most feared 
among angels or demons.
