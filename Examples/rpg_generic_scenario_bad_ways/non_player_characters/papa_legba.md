# Papa Legba

A strange Cajun homeless madman.

He is the guardian of the border between the human world, Hell and
Paradise. He lives in a subway station that he chose to materialize this
border.  It is common knowledge that the fees he requests for the
crossing are often curious natures ...  In the confidences of the
intrigues of the three parties, it has long chosen to remain neutral and
enforce rules that benefit all three. Few people are familiar with this
curious character finally, everything can be sure that even if his body
is mortal, his soul has been around a long time.
