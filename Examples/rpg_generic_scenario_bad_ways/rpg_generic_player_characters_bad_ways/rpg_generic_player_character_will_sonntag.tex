\maketitle

A lousy occult romance writer, Will Sonntag has nevertheless had a few high
moments in his career. His \emph{``Tenebr\ae\ Cantos''} made a few hundred
thousand sells, before Sonntag found himself unable to prolong his inspiration
streak with a worthwhile follow-up. After a few years of dabbling with the
city's intelligentia, of endless days of sobering up and blank pages staring
back at him, reality struck him hard with a few thousand dollars of advance
that his editor wanted to recover.

That might be the time when Sonntag started hearing voices. A constant and
insisting buzz, day and night. Guttural languages, cryptic interjections,
stabbing at his conscience unrelentingly, urging for\ldots what? And then,
as the voices became louder and more demanding in their incomprehensible
babble, came the fleeting shadows of barely suggested horrors. Fugitive shapes
without substance that seemed to echo the voices.

Needless to say, Sonntag's delusions drove away the last people that cared any
damn about his pathetic soul, but not before someone took the care of putting
him in the Meyerling Institute of Mental Health [quote].
