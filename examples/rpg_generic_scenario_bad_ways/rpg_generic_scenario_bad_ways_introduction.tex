\begin{introduction}

Master idea
the first player leaves the psychiatric hospital and meets the second player
(FBI). The introduction ends at the beginning of the questioning of the first
player by the second.

Adventure starts as Will Sonntag is given back his wallet and flat keys, as he
is leaving the Meyerling Institute. His editor, Jennyfer Hennings, is waiting for him in an
old corvette in front of the asylum. Being a old wisened bird from the
publishing industry, Jennyfer Hennings is quite anxious to put Will back in the writing
saddle. Even though Sonntag's case seems desperate, she still dreams of
retiring with a final success on her catalogue.

\begin{acting_directions}
Jennyfer Hennings is not a bad person. Maybe a bit anxious. Maybe she's had too much failures
in her carreer not to have been hardened by the blows. Will Sonntag's return in
the public life is her last chance, so the damn writer'd better do right away
what he's good at! Make her babble about all sorts of trivial things, but 
mention in passing the atrocious murders that have been committed downtown.
\end{acting_direction}

Jennyfer Hennings finally drops Will in front of his building. The PC should fill a bit at
loss, standing in a quiet Brooklyn street on a quiet autumn day. If the PC
turns on the radio or the TV or talks to neighbours, you should mention (once
again as smalltalk) the murders that have been going on since the previous
week. Note that this information should be drowned into a sea of more or less
menacing rumors of comparable weirdness.
