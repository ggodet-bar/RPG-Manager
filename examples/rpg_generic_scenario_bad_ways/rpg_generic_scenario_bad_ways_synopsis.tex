\begin{synopsis}

This scenario is designed for a two-player group. One player character is a
lousy occult romance novel writer freshly out of the asylum. The other player
character is a FBI agent initially set out to question the writer on a series
of atrocious murders. As the story unfolds, the players are led into the
depths of an occult world where angels and demons settle their disputes by
betting on \textit{almost} human horses.
